Purpose: JUnit is designed to simplify unit testing in Java by providing a framework for writing and running tests automatically. It helps developers ensure that individual units of code behave as expected.

Annotations: JUnit uses annotations to identify methods that specify test cases. Annotations like @Test, @Before, @After, @BeforeClass, and @AfterClass are commonly used to mark test methods and setup/teardown methods.

Test Cases: Test cases are written as methods annotated with @Test. These methods contain assertions that verify whether the expected behavior of the code under test is met.

Assertions: JUnit provides a set of assertion methods validate the expected output of the code being tested. If an assertion fails, the test case fails.

Test Suites: Test suites are collections of test cases that are executed together. JUnit allows grouping test cases into suites using the @RunWith and @Suite annotations.

Parameterized Tests: JUnit supports parameterized tests, where the same test case can be executed multiple times with different input parameters. This is useful for testing methods with various inputs.

Test Fixtures: JUnit provides annotations like @Before and @After to define setup and teardown code that should be executed before and after each test method. @BeforeClass and @AfterClass are used for setup and teardown of static resources shared among test methods.

Integration with IDEs and Build Tools: JUnit integrates well with popular Java IDEs like Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, and NetBeans, allowing developers to easily run and debug tests within their development environment. It's also supported by build tools like Maven and Gradle.

Test Runners: JUnit provides different test runners to execute tests. These runners handle the execution of test cases, reporting results, and handling exceptions.
